The operation of a photo studio is organized as follows: a client places an order (photo
printing, film developing) with the receptionist. The receptionist records the clientâ€™s details
(surname) and the desired completion time. Orders are issued on two forms: one for the
client, the other for the photographer.
The price depends on urgency: express orders carry a 25% surcharge. Payment is made
upon completion.
Throughout the day, the receptionist passes orders to the photographer, who processes
them and returns the results. The photographer uses consumables (paper, developer, etc.),
which are accounted for by the studio administrator.
At the end of the day:
The receptionist submits a report on completed orders and revenue.
The photographer submits a report on consumed materials.
